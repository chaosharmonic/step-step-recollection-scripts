# Step Step Recollection (Scripts)

A collection of Deno scripts for managing Stepmania simfiles

Includes tools for batch operations such as:

* Bulk updating chart difficulties
* Converting legacy .sm files to .ssc and updating formatting accordingly
* Exporting simfile metadata to JSON
* Uploading extracted metadata to an API

This is a companion project to [Step Step Recollection](https://github.com/chaosharmonic/step-step-recollection), a workout tracker for rhythm games. At its core, it was built as a seeding tool (the rest mostly aided with data consistency), but I'll be circling back to it periodically as I continue fleshing out the main project's data model.
